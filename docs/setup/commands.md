## Browsing command categories

Upon using the `-help` command, you will be prompted to choose a category. To see the list of commands contained within a category, type the prompt seen below the category name. Category prompts are to be used like so: `-help [category]` .

{% hint style="info" %}
For example: To see commands in the **Games** category, use the `-help games` command.
{% endhint %}

## Using command aliases

Some commands have aliases to make life simpler. For example, the `-truthordare` command can simply be called with `-tod` which is quicker to type than the full command.

Aliases are listed in regular brackets following the full command name in the help list if they exist for any given command.
