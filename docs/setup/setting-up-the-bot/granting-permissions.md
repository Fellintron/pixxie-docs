# Granting permissions

The permissions required to allow PixxieBot to function correctly in your server are as follows:

* [x] Manage Nicknames
* [x] Change Nickname
* [x] Manage Emojis
* [x] Manage Webhooks

{% hint style="danger" %}
These are the **only** permissions PixxieBot requires to work in your server. If your server has granted higher permissions to her role or another role you have assigned to the bot, please make sure you [reset the permissions](granting-permissions.md#resetting-and-updating-pixxiebots-permissions) or fix your role permissions.

## Restricting PixxieBot to one channel

To restrict PixxieBot to only one channel, make sure she's unable to see every other channel in your server.

## Resetting and updating PixxieBot's permissions

Sometimes we add new features that may require more permissions. If this happens, we will notify you in our [support server](https://pixx.ie/support).

{% hint style="info" %}
To reset PixxieBot's permissions [click here](https://pixx.ie/invite) and re-invite the bot to your server. This will overwrite the `@PixxieBot` role permissions in your server without the need to kick the bot.
