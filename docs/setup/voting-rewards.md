# Voting rewards

## What are voting rewards?

All the votes PixxieBot gets on [top.gg](https://pixx.ie/vote) are very much appreciated and as a token of our thanks, weâ€™ve been rewarding voters with Pixos, our in-bot currency.

## How do I vote and get rewards?

Vote for PixxieBot on [top.gg](https://pixx.ie/vote).

## How do I build up a voting streak?

Voting every 12 hours for PixxieBot [on top.gg](https://pixx.ie/vote) is the best way to build a voting streak and gain more rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Voting streaks get reset 12 hours after your previous vote has lost its effect. For example, if you vote at 8AM, top.gg will let you vote again at 8PM the same day. If you vote between 8PM and 8AM the following day, your voting streak will increase (every 12 hours).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**TIP:** Having trouble remembering to vote? Use the `/vote reminders`command to toggle bot DM voting reminders on or off.

## Why have my voting rewards decreased?

Either you lost [your voting streak](voting-rewards.md#how-do-i-build-up-a-voting-streak), or it's Monday! Voting rewards over weekends (Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays) get doubled because votes on top.gg count double on weekends. Your voting rewards will be doubled again this weekend and increase again next week.
