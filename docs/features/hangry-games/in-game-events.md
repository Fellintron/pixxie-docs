# Hangry Games In-Game Events

What keeps Hangry Games so fun and engaging are the different ways users can be eliminated! Here is a list of the different in-game events and what happens.

## Duels

Duels are when PixxieBot randomly picks two tributes, where one of the tributes eliminates the other in a funny food-related way.

## Solo Deaths

The body of a random tribute is found. This player is often eliminated in a clumsy way.

## Feasts Of The Dead

PixxieBot picks out two tributes to put on the menu for the dead tributes. Players who have been eliminated already and are dead at the time a feast appears in the game, can vote for who they want to eat. The tribute who receives the most votes is eaten at the feast and is eliminated. The player with the least votes survives the feast and continues in the game. If no votes are cast, or if the voting results in a draw, the Dead were unable to decide and both tributes are released back into the game.

## Winner

This is always the final message in a Hangry Games simulation. The winner of the game is posted in the final winning message along with some recap statistics from the game.
