## What is Truth or Dare?

Truth or Dare is a classic party-game where you choose to tell a  truth or take a silly dare. It often leads to funny and awkward moments. This version can also be played as a drinking game with your friends!

## How to play
You and your friends take turns running the `/truthordare` command, and choosing either a `truth` or a `dare`. 

You can optionally include your choice while entering the command `/truthordare choice:truth/dare`, or have Pixxiebot tag another user to whom you want to direct it. `/truthordare choice:truth/dare user:<mention>

## Truth

When you have chosen for Truth, PixxieBot will confront you with a potentially awkward question. Answer this question truthfully, or take a shot when you refuse!

## Dare

When you have chosen to receive a Dare, PixxieBot will give you a silly or slightly embarrassing assignment to fulfill.Don’t forget to provide your friends with some picture or video proof of you doing the Dare…When you fail the assignment, or refuse to do it, take another shot!
