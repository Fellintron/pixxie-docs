# Marriages

## Available marriage slots

All users get 3 basic marriage slots. You can get more marriage slots by [subscribing to PixxieBot Premium](https://pixx.ie/premium).

The number of marriage slots varies depending on your Premium tier as follows:

- **VIPixxie:** 11 extra slots (total of 13)
- **Sponsor:** 8 extra slots (total of 11)
- **Top Supporter:** 5 extra slots (total of 8)

{% hint style="info" %}
You get to keep these marriage slots for as long as you're a Premium member. If you fill all your Premium marriage slots then cancel you membership, you will keep your spouses until you divorce them, but you won't be able to marry anyone new unless you divorce all but 2 of your spouses (because your marriage slot limit has been reset to 3).
