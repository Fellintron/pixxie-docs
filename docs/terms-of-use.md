# Terms of Use 

Pixxies Design LTD ("us" or "we" or "our") owns and operates the PixxieBot pixx.ie site ("Site") and the PixxieBot Discord Bot ("Bot"). The following Terms of Use (“TOU”) govern your use of the Site and the Bot. Other sites or content owned or controlled by PixxieBot may have their own terms of use and should be reviewed.

PixxieBot may also offer promotions, contests, services, or features that have their own terms of use or rules, and to the extent any portion of those special terms conflict with these TOU, the special terms will govern for that specific portion.

Using PixxieBot is at-will and can be terminated at any time by either us or you for any reason. By using PixxieBot, you agree to be bound by these TOU. If you do not agree to be so bound, you are not authorised to use the Site or the Bot. These TOU are a legal contract between you and PixxieBot and govern your access to and use of the Bot.

PixxieBot is not affiliated with [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), Cancer Research UK, NASA, RuPaul's Drag Race, WHO, Star Wars, or any other entities we support or list in our services unless otherwise stated.

### PIXXIEBOT

The purpose of PixxieBot is to provide Discord channels with fun and factual commands, helping you build activity on your Discord server and create a community.

The information supplied by PixxieBot is provided for entertainment and informational purposes only. You agree that you will only use PixxieBot, or data/information provided by it, for its intended purposes, and not for other commercial ventures without first seeking approval from PixxieBot.

By using PixxieBot, you may need to interact with other users. You are solely responsible for any such interaction and agree to do so in a manner that is legal, respectable, and consistent with these TOU. PixxieBot is not responsible for the conduct of any other user who may interact with you, regardless of whether or not it is done through interactions with the bot by another user or through PixxieBot's own Discord server.

### LICENSE

PixxieBot hereby grants you a revocable and nonexclusive right and license to use PixxieBot's Site (including any underlying software) and Bot in a manner that is consistent with the other terms in these TOU and PixxieBot's intended purposes. PixxieBot reserves the right to terminate this License for any or no reason and at any time without notice to you, including, but not limited to, for breach of any term contained in these TOU.

This includes the ability to associate a sponsored message (promoting either PixxieBot or a third party) alongside the message. Any attempt to remove or block sponsored messages from your Discord server(s) will result in a temporary or permanent ban of your Discord server(s) from the PixxieBot service at the discretion of PixxieBot.

### TERMS OF USE CHANGES
