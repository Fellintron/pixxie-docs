# Divorcing

## How to divorce a user

There are two ways to divorce a user.

### 1. Divorce while mentioning

Use the `-divorce @mention` divorce someone you're married to in a mutual server. This will ping the member you're divorcing.

### 2. Divorce without mentioning

This method doesn't notify the person of your divorce.

1. Use the `-divorce` command to see a list of the people you're married to.
2. From the list, pick the number of the person you want to divorce, then do `-divorce number` for example, if I want to divorce the second person on my list, I would use `-divorce 2`.

This second method is especially useful if the person you want to divorce no longer shares any mutual servers with you or has deleted their account.
